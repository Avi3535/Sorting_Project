# Sorting_Project

This was a course project for one of the courses I took at the University of Victoria as a graduate student - Mechatronics.

The sensors/motors used in this projects were:
    *Hall Sensor
    *Reflective and Optical Sensor
    *Optical Sensor
    *DC motor and motor driver
    *Stepper motor and motor driver
   
All of these sensors were interfaced to the ATMega 2560 microcontroller and were programmed using the Atmel Studio using C programming language.

The video to the working system is : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o4t4lf4_W2uOWemKVXydVFPRtM4a6agu/view?usp=sharing

* NOTE : THE CODE ATTACHED WILL NOT WORK AS IT IS BUT. THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS AN LCD LIBRARY WHICH IS NOT ATTACHED (WORKING ON MY OWN LIBRARY). THE LIBRARY USED WAS GIVEN BY THE LAB ASSISTANTS AND PROF OF THE COURSE. BUT THE CODE ATTACHED CAN GIVE A BRIEF IDEA OF THE PROJECT.
